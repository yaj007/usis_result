It is solved by my reporting to BracU IT:

BUG BOUNTY HUNTING OF USIS: 

You can use it by running the .py file, 

First Enter your target ID 
Then, Enter your target Name 

By this things, you can download your friends marksheet from usis server of Brac University. 

Noted: 
First of all, you have to login your usis account, then left from the site, but don't logout. Always confirm that you have an access of usis server. Then, just run the code , and you will get a link. If you click on the link , automatically your friend's marksheet report will be downloaded. 

Taking Name and ID from Discord:
You can also take the academic Name and ID of your target person from CSE Advising discord panel. Just mention from any text box like @akash , hopefully you will get your target profile .

Some error problems:
If you face any problems like report card not downloaded,Â  you can use Free Download Manager or Internet Download Manager. 

Hopefully, you get your target report card.
